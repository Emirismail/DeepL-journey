# DeepL-Journey
During this non extra-terresterel journey , I have tried to collect basic concepts of modern neural networks and their applications especially in computer vision. We will go through the simplest linear models and stochastic methods for optimization. 
We will try next to combine fully connected, convolutional and recurrent layers to built more complex models. TensorFlow framework and a bit from Keras will support our work.
